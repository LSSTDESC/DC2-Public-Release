## Downloading Data

### LSSTDESC Data Portal

The [LSSTDESC Data Portal](https://lsstdesc-portal.nersc.gov/) allows anyone to transfer the DC2 Public Release data using Globus.   

To get started click Login to authenticate into Globus using your organizational login or existing GlobusID. If needed, create a GlobusID using the "Sign Up" link.

Once authenticated with Globus, users may transfer either whole directories or individual files.

If you want to download files to a local machine (e.g., your laptop), you will need to [set up Globus Personal Connect](02_setup_globus_personal_connect.md) on that machine.
