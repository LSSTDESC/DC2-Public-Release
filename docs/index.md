## Instructions

### Overview

Start by downloading data files from the Portal. Note that the complete dataset is about 180 Gbytes; you may want to start with a subset. We recommend the sample subset required by the tutorial notebooks (I'm thinking details of downloading the subset will be explained more fully in 01). At this point you may access the files directly using standard Parquet tools.

Alternatively, for a higher-level interface, you may install and configure the Python package GCRCatalogs.

In order to get some experience with the data we have provided a pair of Jupyter notebooks. GCRCatalogs is required in order to run them.
